## Sermon

{{< collapse summary="**Sermon Summary**">}}

Revelation 21 lifts the eyes to a promised future where Jesus makes all things new—anchoring a new year in a better hope. The vision begins with a new heaven and new earth and the holy city, New Jerusalem, descending “as a bride adorned for her husband.” This is not merely a place; it is a people. The redeemed are purified, ordered, and made ready for endless fellowship with their Bridegroom. What makes that future most compelling is not only the absence of sorrow but the presence of God himself. He will dwell with his people, wipe away every tear, banish death and pain, and restore unbroken communion like Eden, forever.

This hope rests on the finished work of Christ. The One who says, “It is done,” is the Alpha and the Omega—the Lord of history who brings every promise to completion. To the thirsty he gives the water of life without payment, the grace already secured by his cross and guaranteed by his resurrection. Heaven is for those who overcome—who, by persevering faith, cling to Christ rather than to the passing pleasures of sin. Their inheritance is intimate: “I will be his God and he will be my son.” That adoption, tasted now by the Spirit, will be enjoyed in full when faith becomes sight.

This future presses into present faithfulness. Holiness is not prudishness; it is love that seeks another’s nearness to Jesus. The imagery of a bride prepared for her husband calls for purity that nurtures devotion—refusing to use others and instead seeking their deepest good in Christ. Joy today is mingled with sorrow, yet the promise stands: the coming “new normal” is unending, uninterrupted joy. In a year of resolutions, the most important resolve is to cling to Christ, thirst for his presence, and live now as citizens of the city that is coming. For those who refuse him—the cowardly, faithless, and idolatrous—Scripture issues a sober warning of the second death. But to all who turn and trust him, the door of grace stands open and the water of life flows freely.

> [1] Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. [2] And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. [3] And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. [4] He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”
> 
> [5] And he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.” [6] And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment. [7] The one who conquers will have this heritage, and I will be his God and he will be my son. [8] But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”
