## Sermon Passage
{{< collapse summary="**Isaiah 6:1-7**" >}}

> [1] In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. [2] Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. [3] And one called to another and said:
>
> “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;  
the whole earth is full of his glory!"
> 
> [4] And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. [5] And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!”
> 
> [6] Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. [7] And he touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”

## Discussion Questions

### Question 1

In what way(s) do we see how deductive our culture's influence on us can be as Christmas time? Are we conformed by the world, or by God's Word (Rom 12:2)?

### Question 2

Take some time and walk through the four names of the Messiah:

* Wonderful Counselor
* Mighty God
* Everlasting Father
* Prince of Peace.

Briefly discuss what each name means and what they teach us about the Messiah.

### Question 3

Which one of these names grabs your attention the most in the current season of life? Why does it impact you most deeply in the present?

Feel free to share about a current struggle you are facing and how the Messiah is meeting you in that place of hardship.

### Question 4

Discuss the zeal of the Lord in Isaiah 9:7.

How does it affect you to know that God has a white-hot passion for your salvation and the salvation of peoples in your life who do not know him?
