Because we are using the free plan for pastors.ai, I am unable to process the video due to it being over the maximum allowed length. These notes were instead created with Gemini.

## Sermon

{{< collapse summary="**Matthew 4:18-22**">}}

> [18] While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. [19] And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.” [20] Immediately they left their nets and followed him. [21] And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them. 22 Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.

[18] And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. [19] Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, [20] teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”

In following Jesus, we have to recognize that discipleship isn’t a passive hobby; it’s a specific "Pathway" we choose to walk every day. Think of it like a narrow mountain trail—it’s often hard to find and even harder to stay on, but it is the only path that leads to the right destination. To be a fully functioning disciple, you have to move beyond just sitting in a pew and start engaging in four specific areas of your life: Community, Class, Chore, and Calling.

First, you cannot walk this trail alone. You need Community. This isn't just about being friendly; it’s about koinonia—that deep, intimate fellowship where you are truly known. You need a small group of people to support you, pray for you, and hold you accountable.

Second, you must commit to your Class. A disciple is, by definition, a "learner." You have to be disciplined in studying the Word and taking advantage of opportunities to grow your understanding of your faith. You can’t follow someone you don't truly know.

Third, you have to be willing to do the Chore. In any healthy household, there are jobs that simply must be done—whether it’s serving in the nursery, helping with a meal, or cleaning up after an event. These are the general responsibilities we all share to keep the "household of God" running.

But finally, you need to discover your Calling. This is different from a chore. Your calling is that specific area of ministry where God has uniquely "tooled" and gifted you. When you operate in your calling, it doesn't feel like a burden because you are doing exactly what you were created to do for the Kingdom.

As you reflect on your own walk, ask yourself: Which of these is missing? Are you learning but not serving? Are you serving but doing it alone? To be the disciple God called you to be, you have to leave your "nets" behind and commit to the whole path. Let’s encourage one another to step fully into these four areas so we can effectively fulfill the Great Commission together.

## Discussion Questions

### Question 1

Pastor Joe compared discipleship to a narrow, sometimes difficult mountain trail. Looking back at your own spiritual journey, what has been a "narrow" or difficult stretch of the path for you lately?

### Question 2

We often talk about "Community" as the first 'C'. Beyond just showing up to this group, what does deep, biblical *koinonia* (fellowship) look like to you in practice?

### Question 3

A disciple is a "learner" (Class). How do you personally stay disciplined in studying God’s Word when life gets busy, and what is one thing the Holy Spirit has been teaching you recently?

### Question 4

Pastor Joe distinguished between "Chores" (general needs of the church) and "Calling" (your unique spiritual gifts). Are you currently serving in a "Chore" capacity, or have you identified a specific "Calling" that fits how God "tooled" you?

### Question 5

To follow Jesus, the first disciples had to leave their boats and nets behind. Is there a "net"—a comfort, a habit, or a priority—that you feel God is asking you to drop so you can follow Him more closely?

### Question 6

Of the Four C’s (Community, Class, Chore, Calling), which one do you feel is the strongest in your life right now, and which one needs the most prayer and attention?
