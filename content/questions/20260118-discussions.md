## Sermon

{{< collapse summary="**Sermon Summary**">}}

The service opens with warm community moments: farewells for Marty and Cindy as they relocate to Fairhope, updates about men’s and women’s ministries, an upcoming potluck and groundbreaking, and a memorial for long-time member Joan Bennett. Attention turns to missionary work, with a heartfelt prayer for a team traveling to Eleuthera and a plea that gospel work be accompanied by prayer, care, and safe return. Transitioning to Scripture, the congregation is invited into First Corinthians, with the speaker explaining that this letter will both comfort and confront, showing believers their victories and failures as a faithful church family.

A personal vignette about moving for seminary and meeting a future spouse frames the pastoral approach—relationships, naming, and mutual respect matter. That anecdote leads into a sustained theological emphasis: the identity of the believer. Drawing from Paul’s opening to the Corinthians, the central claim is that those who belong to Christ are saints by declaration, not by moral achievement. Sainthood is presented as a status given through Christ’s finished work and received by faith, not something earned through attendance, giving, or personal effort.

The text’s prayer for grace and peace is underscored as more than liturgy; it points to an active, present blessing rooted in God’s work that shapes daily life. The call is pastoral and pastoral-adjacent: for those who have never trusted Christ, repentance and faith are urged as the doorway into this identity; for believers, a sober invitation to be shaped into the image of Christ is sounded. The series title—“Saints becoming saints”—captures the trajectory: a declared identity that is meant to be realized in progressive holiness through the Spirit’s work.

Practical invitations close the assembly: to engage in church life via membership, to participate in the upcoming Bible reading plan beginning February 1, and to come forward for prayer. The tone remains pastoral yet urgent—God’s grace already declares believers holy, and that declaration compels ongoing transformation, mission, and communal care.

## Discussion Questions

*Since Monday is a holiday, I have used alternative questions to give content for all groups. If Jeff sends out his own questions, I will try to update the page.*

### Observation Questions

1. According to verse 2, who is Paul addressing, and what specific title does he use to describe their identity?
2. In verse 3, what two specific blessings does Paul pray for the believers to receive from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ?
3. Based on the opening of this letter, is the status of being a "saint" something the Corinthians achieved through their own effort, or is it something they were "called" into?

### Interpretation Questions

1. Paul addresses the church in Corinth as "sanctified" and "saints," yet the rest of the letter deals with their many moral failures and victories. Why is it significant that Paul establishes their identity as saints *before* addressing their behavior?
2. There is often a stigma that "sainthood" is reserved for "super Christians" who exhibit "extra holy behavior." How does the biblical definition of a saint as a "legal, relational declaration" from God challenge this common misunderstanding?
3. The prayer for "grace and peace" is described as an active, present blessing. How does the "grace of God" specifically serve as the foundation for experiencing the "peace of God" in a believer's daily life?

### Application Questions

1. It is a common temptation to try to earn God’s favor through church attendance, giving, or religious labor. In what areas of your life are you still treating your faith like a "report card" instead of a response to a gift?
2. Being a saint is an identity, not an achievement. How would your approach to this coming week change if you truly believed your standing with God was based entirely on Christ’s work and not your own performance?
3. The Christian journey is one of "saints becoming saints"—growing into the image of who God says we already are. Is there a specific area of your life where you have grown "comfortable" with sin? How can you yield that area to the Lord’s control today?
4. Receiving the gospel requires renouncing the effort to earn God’s favor. If you were to be completely honest, are you currently resting in God’s grace, or are you exhausted from trying to be "holy enough"? How can this group support you in trusting Christ’s finished work?
