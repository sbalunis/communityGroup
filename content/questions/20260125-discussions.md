## Sermon

{{< collapse summary="**Sermon Summary**">}}

The congregation is reminded that hardship and inconvenience—like an ice storm—do not cancel the call to worship or the need for spiritual vigilance. Turning to the short but fierce letter of Jude, the speaker emphasizes a posture of holy contention: Christians must “agonize” for the faith once delivered to the saints by persevering in God’s love. That persevering love is not passive sentiment but an active way of life marked by growth in doctrine, Spirit-led prayer, patient hope, mercy toward doubters, evangelistic urgency, and personal holiness.

Jude’s compressed counsel is unpacked into a practical rule of discipleship. Believers are to build themselves up in the most holy faith by a sustained engagement with Scripture so that the gospel becomes both the shallow entry point and the inexhaustible deep. Prayer is portrayed as intimate, Spirit-enabled conversation that reshapes desire and supplies needed intercession even when words fail. Waiting for Christ’s mercy is an active waiting—trusting amid suffering, encouraged by the cloud of witnesses and confident in the final salvation God intends.

Mercy and rescue are described as costly ministry at the edge of danger: believers ought to reach out to those floundering, “snatching” them from judgment while maintaining a sober fear of the corrupting influence of sin. Holiness is urged not as perfection but as a resolute hatred of the garments stained by the flesh—a daily pattern of repentance and separation from sin. These commitments together form the way to “keep yourselves in the love of God,” the central command that makes contending possible.

Practical applications are offered: join in communal Bible reading to build doctrinal stamina, cultivate a praying life that expects God’s provision, and engage in merciful rescue without naïveté. The portrait is pastoral and urgent—discipleship requires full engagement, communal support, and spiritual disciplines so the church might remain a faithful bride to Christ until his return.

> [3] Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints. [4] For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.

> [17] But you must remember, beloved, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. [18] They said to you, “In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions.” [19] It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit. [20] But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, [21] keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life. [22] And have mercy on those who doubt; [23] save others by snatching them out of the fire; to others show mercy with fear, hating even the garment stained by the flesh.

## Discussion Questions

### Observation Questions

1. According to Jude 20-23, what are the specific actions believers are instructed to take in order to "keep yourselves in the love of God"?
2. The word "contend" in Jude 3 is described as "agonizing," like an athlete in an intense struggle. What exactly does Jude say we are to contend for?
3. Jude describes different ways to show mercy in verses 22-23. What are the differences between how we are to treat "those who doubt" and how we are to "save others"? What specific actions or attitudes are mentioned for each group?

### Interpretation Questions

1. What does it mean to "build yourselves up in your most holy faith"? How can the gospel be both simple enough for a child to enjoy and deep enough that you can spend your whole life exploring it without touching the bottom?
2. Jude tells us to pray "in the Holy Spirit." Based on the description from Romans 8, what does the Spirit do for us in prayer, especially when we don't know what to say? How does this change our understanding of what prayer is?
3. The command to "save others by snatching them out of the fire" is followed by a warning to show mercy "with fear, hating even the garment stained by the flesh." What is the danger being described here? Why is it important to have both mercy and fear when helping those caught in sin?

### Application Questions

1. We are called to "contend" or "agonize" for the faith. In what areas of your life do you feel the world is pushing against your faith, requiring you to put in a "full orbed and all engaging effort" to stand firm?
2. We live in a "kingdom of noise" that makes it hard to pray. What are the biggest sources of "noise" or busyness in your life that keep you from prayer? What is one small step you could take this week to carve out more time for that intimate conversation with God?
3. George Mueller prayed with thanksgiving for food he didn't have yet, confident God would provide. When is it hardest for you to trust God's provision and pray with that kind of confidence? What promises from God can help you trust Him more, even before you see the answer?
4. Jude calls us to show mercy to those who doubt and to snatch others from the fire. Is there someone in your life who you need to show mercy "with fear", helping them back on the journey without getting caught up in the flames yourself?
