Sermon Questions

In what way(s) do we see how deductive our culture&rsquo;s influence on us can be as Christmas time? Are we conformed by the world, or by God&rsquo;s Word (Rom 12:2)?
Take some time and walk through the four names of the Messiah: Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Briefly discuss what each name means and what they teach us about teh Messiah.
Which one of these names grabs your attention the most in the current season of life? Why does it impact you most deeply in teh present? Feel free to share about a current struggle you are facing and hwo the MEssiah is meeting you in that place of hardship.
Discuss the zeal of teh Lord in Isaiah 9:7. How does it affect you to know that God has a white-hot passion for your salvation and the salvation of peoples in your life who do not know him?
